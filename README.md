**How to use:**

Enter a string of the form: "1111_0000_1111" in the input, where "1" is a live cell, "0" is a dead cell and "_" is a new line.

**Rules:**
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

**Game ends if:**
- There are no living cells
- The current generation is no different from the next
